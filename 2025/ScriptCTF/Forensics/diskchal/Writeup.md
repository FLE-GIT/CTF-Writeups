## üß† Solution Strategy

We're given a file `stick.img` and we're tasked with finding a vanished flag. We first start by checking what kind of file it is with `file`:

![](diskchal%20-%20image.png)

It seems to be a FAT32 volume, so we start off by mounting it and trying to read from it:

This gives us two files and upon reading them we get the hint that it might be some hidden or embedded file:

So the next thing we try is to Binwalk and check for embedded files:

We find gunzip compressed data, and to extract this we can use Binwalk to get the embedded files in a new folder:

Inside this folder we find the `flag.txt` folder with the flag: 

```bash
scriptCTF{1_l0v3_m461c_7r1ck5}
```
